# Thread Network Power Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis research project on Thread Network Power Optimization using Genetic Algorithm. The aim of this project is to develop a genetic algorithm that can optimize the power consumption of thread networks while maintaining or improving performance.

## Code Structure
The code includes the implementation of the genetic algorithm, as well as the testing and evaluation of the algorithm on different thread network configurations. The repository also includes the data and results obtained from the experiments. The code is written in Python and it is well commented, making it easy to understand and replicate the results.

## Usage
Feel free to use, modify and distribute the code for research purposes, with proper citation to my work.

## Note
Please note that this is a research project and the results are still under evaluation and not yet published in any scientific journal or conference.
